How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and ``service_identity`` is no different.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started:

- Try to limit each pull request to one change only.
- To run the test suite, all you need is a recent tox_.
  It will ensure the test suite runs with all dependencies against all Python versions just as it will on `Travis CI`_.
  If you lack some Python version, you can can always limit the environments like ``tox -e py27,py35`` (in that case you may want to look into pyenv_ that makes it very easy to install many different Python versions in parallel).
- Make sure your changes pass our CI_.
  You won't get any feedback until it's green unless you ask for it.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Don’t break `backward compatibility`_.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
  This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won’t be merged.
- Write `good test docstrings`_.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- If you address review feedback, make sure to bump the pull request.
  Maintainers don’t receive notifications if you push new commits.
